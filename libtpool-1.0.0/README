** First step:
   config compile option in the file: config.make
   there are two platforms was supported: MIPS and X86, see the files: mips_env.mk and x86_env.mk

** Second step:
   make {clean,all,install}

** And then:
   We can to find the test program in the directory: ./bin

** API:
   tpool_service.h  FOR C
   tpool_wrapper.h  FOR C++

** API Usage:
   Reference the test cases in the directory: ./test

** Makefile
   When you want to use this service in your source code, just including path in your makefile.
